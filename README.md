# school-management-system

A school managemnt system.

## About
This is a school managemnet system(SMS) that can be used to manage secondary schools. This has been coded to work as a desktop application without connecting to the internet. It was coded with PHP mostly as part of my projects to build up my portfolios
in PHP language

## Technologies used in this project;
* `PHP` - I used the PHP language as the main language for this project together with javascript for the frontend and the backend due to the ease in their operability. No frameworks were used for PHP but for javascript, i used jquery for ajax requests being sent to database and getting back the response to populate the DOM
* `javascript/jquery/ajax` - This was used for making the application more dynamic, for things like button clicks. Jquery was used for dom selection while ajax was used for sending requests to database and getting response without page refresh. All scripts are in the subfolder, admin/scripts. These have also been used to create the side navigation bar for the project.
* `PHP desktop` - PHP Desktop is an open source project founded by Czarek Tomczak in 2012 to provide a way for developing native desktop GUI applications using web technologies such as PHP, HTML5, JavaScript and SQLite. For the download, check this link

* `Inno setup compiler` - Inno Setup is a free script-driven installation system software for creating Windows app installer. I used this after project completion to compile the whole project and create the .exe file which can then be used as an installation file in another users computer. The download can be found <a href='https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php'>here.</a>
*  `DB Browser(SQLite)` - I used this as a database to hold the data. I chose this since it is a serverless database and portable, so it can be carried alongside the application without having to install XAMMP or other servers.
*  `SQL` - This, i used to query the database and create a seamless connection between the application frontend and the backend.
*  `CSS` - For the frontend, i used bootstrap offline for dynamics of the application. For icons, i used the fontawesome icons which i downloaded and used locally. The css sheet for bootstrap is the bootstrap.min.css. For fontawesome, i used the all.css style sheet and the webfonts folder. My custom CSS is in the styles/styles.css file.
