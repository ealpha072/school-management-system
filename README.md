# school-management-system

A school managemnt system.

## About
This is a school managemnet system(SMS) that can be used to manage secondary schools. This has been coded to work as a desktop application without connecting to the internet. It was coded with PHP mostly as part of my projects to build up my portfolios
in PHP language

## Technologies used in this project;
* PHP - I used the PHP language as the main language for this project together with javascript for the frontend and the backend due to the ease in their operability. No frameworks were used for PHP but for javascript, i used jquery for ajax requests being sent to database and getting back the response to populate the DOM
* javascript/jquery/ajax - This was used for making the application more dynamic, for things like button clicks. Jquery was used for dom selection while ajax was used for sending requests to database and getting response without page refresh. All scripts are in the subfolder, admin/scripts. These have also been used to create the side navigation bar for the project.
